-This app is purely created in JavaScript
-This credit card app catches the type of card during the user input only; the logo changes according to the card type- AMEX, MAESTRO, MASTERCARD, VISA, UNIONPAY, DINERSCLUB, DISCOVER JCB.
-Users have to fill all the fields- Card Number, FullName, Year and Month of expiry and CVV as all are required fields.
-Values are displayed at the same time when the user inputs the data to the text boxes.
-All the validations take place simultaneously (during user input).
-There's a check on card number and cvv that they cannot be anything except numeric.
-When a user fills CVV, the card flips and we can see the backside of it. CVV cannot be less than3 digits or more than 4 digits.
-The card will not flip back till the time user provides a valid CVV.
