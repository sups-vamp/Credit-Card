- This app is purely created in JavaScript<br>
- This credit card app catches the type of card during the user input only; the logo changes according to the card type- AMEX, MAESTRO, MASTERCARD, VISA, UNIONPAY, DINERSCLUB, DISCOVER JCB.<br>
- Users have to fill all the fields- Card Number, FullName, Year and Month of expiry and CVV as all are required fields.<br>
- Values are displayed at the same time when the user inputs the data to the text boxes.<br>
- All the validations take place simultaneously (during user input).<br>
- There's a check on card number and cvv that they cannot be anything except numeric.<br>
- When a user fills CVV, the card flips and we can see the backside of it. CVV cannot be less than3 digits or more than 4 digits.<br>
- The card will not flip back till the time user provides a valid CVV.<br>
